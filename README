Tiny PHP MVC framework.

** Even though this is very open source, I'm not a helpdesk. You're free to copy and alter, but errors are to be directed elsewhere **

Models: Uses ActiveRecordObjects with custom relations (_GETTERS) and anything you might want to add.
Views: Uses own TemplateEngine (native PHP) with Helpers.
Controllers: Uses a very small, very fast Dispatcher with named URLs: /admin-subsection-client-14/details/save

Models can be found in
	source/include/models/
		with the necessary base classes in
			source/include/models/db/
Views can be found in
	source/include/views/
		with as many sub folders as wanted  and
		with the template base classes in 
			source/include/
Controllers can be found in
	source/controllers/
		with as many subfolders as wanted.
		Controllers themselves can have 'wildcards'. The present exmaple is
			source/controllers/admin/clubs-N/resources/...
				which would be called by URL: /admin-clubs-481-resources...
		For details, check the Dispatcher code:
			source/controllers/inc.cls.__topmodule.php

Todo:
- Implement Dwoo as Template engine? OR make something friendly to inject stuff into <head> (but not like before!)
- Routes for the Dispatcher
- Some kind of very-low-level ACL
