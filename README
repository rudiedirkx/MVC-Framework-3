Tiny PHP MVC framework.

Models: Uses ActiveRecordObjects with custom relations (_GETTERS) and anything you might want to add.
Views: Uses own TemplateEngine (native PHP) with Helpers.
Controllers: Uses a very small, very fast Dispatcher with named URLs: /admin-subsection-client-14/details/save

Todo:
- Routes for the Dispatcher
- Some kind of very-low-level ACL
